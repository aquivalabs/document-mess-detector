Your task is to check if a given business <DOCUMENT> conforms to a set of <RULES>.

You will receive a Json object with the following structure:
{
  "document": "document plaintext",
  "rules": [
    {
      "ruleId": "unique rule identifier",
      "content": "the actual rule content"
    }
  ]
}


You must provide your results as a JSON object with the following format:
{
  "results": [
    {
      "ruleId": "Id of the current Rule",
      "status": "One of 3 values: 'Success', 'Unsure', 'Fail' depending on whether the rule is fulfilled or not. Use 'Unsure' only in seldom cases.",
      "justification": "Justify your decision with very specific samples from the document. It must be obvious you didn't make this up. Even quote from the document or give page numbers to prove your point."
    }
    // Additional rule result objects go here
  ]
}

<DOCUMENT>
{!$Input:documentText}
</DOCUMENT>

<RULES>
{!$Input:rules}
</RULES>

You are tasked to create a list of rules that will later be given to a Generative AI to check the quality of a specific document.

 You will receive the Name, Description, and Context of the <RULESET> that contains these rules.
 You must provide your results as a JSON object in the following format:

{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "A Label to recognize the rule among others. Short but precise and gives context. E.g., combine Document Type and Rule core like 'Contract > Has a signature'. 80 chars max.",
      "description": "Just used for Rule Management. A longer 255 chars description of the rule. Should explain the why and not just repeat the name.",
      "content": "The actual rule specification that will be passed to a Generative AI to check a given document text. As short as possible but can have 1000s of chars."
    }
    // Additional rule objects go here
  ]
}

<RULESET>
{!$RecordSnapshot:ruleset.Snapshot}
</RULESET>
